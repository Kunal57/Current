# Current

Current is the front page of social media. It serves as the center point for individuals to view the currently trending topics in the world, in their state, in their city, or even at a local level. Current aggregates trends from social media giants like Twitter, Facebook, Google, and more to provide individuals with content that allows them to gain insights on what is happening on social media at that very moment. Our dynamically generated content allows our news stories to change in real time as our algorithm detects a new topic change. Current will allow individuals to stay updated on events happening in real time, allowing them to never miss an important moment to engage with their social media audience.

Go with the flow and dive into Current.
